This project is about doing offline near field chat communication and broadcasting messages in the nearby area.
I have often wondered , if our internet goes down , that how will we communicate.

This project uses 2 techniques mainly, using the wifi meta information to transfer short messages in nearby area, and using TCP protocol to transfer long messges.
Do contact me if you have any doubts about this project : atulpasw@gmail.com .
